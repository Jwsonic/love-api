# love.thread

Allows you to work with threads.

Threads are separate Lua environments, running in parallel to the main code. As their code runs separately, they can be used to compute complex operations without adversely affecting the frame rate of the main thread. However, as they are separate environments, they cannot access the variables and functions of the main thread, and communication between threads is limited.

All LOVE objects (userdata) are shared among threads so you'll only have to send their references across threads. You may run into concurrency issues if you manipulate an object on multiple threads at the same time.

When a Thread is started, it only loads the love.thread module. Every other module has to be loaded with require.

## Types

## Channel

An object which can be used to send and receive data between different threads.

**Constructors:** [newChannel](#lovethreadnewchannel), [getChannel](#lovethreadgetchannel)

**Supertypes:** Object

### Methods

#### Channel:clear

Clears all the messages in the Channel queue.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### Channel:demand

Retrieves the value of a Channel message and removes it from the message queue.

It waits until a message is in the queue then returns the message value.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | Variant | The contents of the message. |

### Variant 2

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| timeout | number |  | The maximum amount of time to wait. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | Variant | The contents of the message or nil if the timeout expired. |

#### Channel:getCount

Retrieves the number of messages in the thread Channel queue.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| count | number | The number of messages in the queue. |

#### Channel:hasRead

Gets whether a pushed value has been popped or otherwise removed from the Channel.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | number |  | An id value previously returned by Channel:push. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hasread | boolean | Whether the value represented by the id has been removed from the Channel via Channel:pop, Channel:demand, or Channel:clear. |

#### Channel:peek

Retrieves the value of a Channel message, but leaves it in the queue.

It returns nil if there's no message in the queue.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | Variant | The contents of the message. |

#### Channel:performAtomic

Executes the specified function atomically with respect to this Channel.

Calling multiple methods in a row on the same Channel is often useful. However if multiple Threads are calling this Channel's methods at the same time, the different calls on each Thread might end up interleaved (e.g. one or more of the second thread's calls may happen in between the first thread's calls.)

This method avoids that issue by making sure the Thread calling the method has exclusive access to the Channel until the specified function has returned.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| func | function |  | The function to call, the form of function(channel, arg1, arg2, ...) end. The Channel is passed as the first argument to the function when it is called. |
| ... | any |  | Additional arguments that the given function will receive when it is called. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ret1 | any | The first return value of the given function (if any.) |
| ... | any | Any other return values. |

#### Channel:pop

Retrieves the value of a Channel message and removes it from the message queue.

It returns nil if there are no messages in the queue.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | Variant | The contents of the message. |

#### Channel:push

Send a message to the thread Channel.

See Variant for the list of supported types.
