## Functions

## love.window.close

Closes the window. It can be reopened with love.window.setMode.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.window.fromPixels

Converts a number from pixels to density-independent units.

The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.fromPixels(1600) would return 800 in that case.

This function converts coordinates from pixels to the size users are expecting them to display at onscreen. love.window.toPixels does the opposite. The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

Most LÃ–VE functions return values and expect arguments in terms of pixels rather than density-independent units.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pixelvalue | number |  | A number in pixels to convert to density-independent units. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | number | The converted number, in density-independent units. |

### Variant 2

The units of love.graphics.getWidth, love.graphics.getHeight, love.mouse.getPosition, mouse events, love.touch.getPosition, and touch events are always in terms of pixels.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| px | number |  | The x-axis value of a coordinate in pixels. |
| py | number |  | The y-axis value of a coordinate in pixels. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | The converted x-axis value of the coordinate, in density-independent units. |
| y | number | The converted y-axis value of the coordinate, in density-independent units. |

## love.window.getDPIScale

Gets the DPI scale factor associated with the window.

The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.getDPIScale() would return 2.0 in that case.

The love.window.fromPixels and love.window.toPixels functions can also be used to convert between units.

The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

The units of love.graphics.getWidth, love.graphics.getHeight, love.mouse.getPosition, mouse events, love.touch.getPosition, and touch events are always in terms of pixels.

| fullscreen | boolean |  | Whether to enter or exit fullscreen mode. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |

### Variant 2

If fullscreen mode is entered and the window size doesn't match one of the monitor's display modes (in normal fullscreen mode) or the window size doesn't match the desktop size (in 'desktop' fullscreen mode), the window will be resized appropriately. The window will revert back to its original size again when fullscreen mode is exited using this function.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fullscreen | boolean |  | Whether to enter or exit fullscreen mode. |
| fstype | [FullscreenType](#fullscreentype) |  | The type of fullscreen mode to use. |

**Returns:**

## love.window.setMode

Sets the display mode and properties of the window.

If width or height is 0, setMode will use the width and height of the desktop. 

Changing the display mode may have side effects: for example, canvases will be cleared and values sent to shaders with canvases beforehand or re-draw to them afterward if you need to.

* If fullscreen is enabled and the width or height is not supported (see resize event will be triggered.

* If the fullscreen type is 'desktop', then the window will be automatically resized to the desktop resolution.

* If the width and height is bigger than or equal to the desktop dimensions (this includes setting both to 0) and fullscreen is set to false, it will appear 'visually' fullscreen, but it's not true fullscreen and conf.lua (i.e. t.window = false) and use this function to manually create the window, then you must not call any other love.graphics.* function before this one. Doing so will result in undefined behavior and/or crashes because OpenGL cannot function properly without a window.

* Transparent backgrounds are currently not supported.

## love.window.toPixels

Converts a number from density-independent units to pixels.

The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.toPixels(800) would return 1600 in that case.

This is used to convert coordinates from the size users are expecting them to display at onscreen to pixels. love.window.fromPixels does the opposite. The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

Most LÃ–VE functions return values and expect arguments in terms of pixels rather than density-independent units.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | number |  | A number in density-independent units to convert to pixels. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pixelvalue | number | The converted number, in pixels. |

### Variant 2

The units of love.graphics.getWidth, love.graphics.getHeight, love.mouse.getPosition, mouse events, love.touch.getPosition, and touch events are always in terms of pixels.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | number |  | The x-axis value of a coordinate in density-independent units to convert to pixels. |
| y | number |  | The y-axis value of a coordinate in density-independent units to convert to pixels. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| px | number | The converted x-axis value of the coordinate, in pixels. |
| py | number | The converted y-axis value of the coordinate, in pixels. |

## love.window.updateMode

Sets the display mode and properties of the window, without modifying unspecified properties.

If width or height is 0, updateMode will use the width and height of the desktop. 

Changing the display mode may have side effects: for example, canvases will be cleared. Make sure to save the contents of canvases beforehand or re-draw to them afterward if you need to.

If fullscreen is enabled and the width or height is not supported (see resize event will be triggered.

If the fullscreen type is 'desktop', then the window will be automatically resized to the desktop resolution.

Transparent backgrounds are currently not supported.
