Read more about gamma-correct rendering here, here, and here.

In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

### Variant 1

| g | number |  | The green channel of the sRGB color to convert. |

## love.math.getRandomSeed

Gets the seed of the random number generator.

The seed is split into two numbers due to Lua's use of doubles for all number values - doubles can't accurately represent integer  values above 2^53, but the seed can be an integer value up to 2^64.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| low | number | Integer number representing the lower 32 bits of the random number generator's 64 bit seed value. |
| high | number | Integer number representing the higher 32 bits of the random number generator's 64 bit seed value. |

## love.math.getRandomState

Gets the current state of the random number generator. This returns an opaque implementation-dependent string which is only useful for later use with love.math.setRandomState or RandomGenerator:setState.

This is different from love.math.getRandomSeed in that getRandomState gets the random number generator's current state, whereas getRandomSeed gets the previously set seed number.

The value of the state string does not depend on the current operating system.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

## love.math.isConvex

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| convex | boolean | Whether the given polygon is convex. |

## love.math.linearToGamma

Converts a color from linear-space (RGB) to gamma-space (sRGB). This is useful when storing linear RGB color values in an image, because the linear RGB color space has less precision than sRGB for dark colors, which can result in noticeable color banding when drawing.

In general, colors chosen based on what they look like on-screen are already in gamma-space and should not be double-converted. Colors calculated using math are often in the linear RGB space.

Read more about gamma-correct rendering here, here, and here.

In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

## RandomGenerator

A random number generation object which has its own random state.

**Constructors:** [newRandomGenerator](#lovemathnewrandomgenerator)

**Supertypes:** Object

### Methods

#### RandomGenerator:getSeed

Gets the seed of the random number generator object.

The seed is split into two numbers due to Lua's use of doubles for all number values - doubles can't accurately represent integer  values above 2^53, but the seed value is an integer number in the range of 2^64 - 1.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| low | number | Integer number representing the lower 32 bits of the RandomGenerator's 64 bit seed value. |
| high | number | Integer number representing the higher 32 bits of the RandomGenerator's 64 bit seed value. |

#### RandomGenerator:getState

Gets the current state of the random number generator. This returns an opaque string which is only useful for later use with RandomGenerator:setState in the same major version of LÃ–VE.

This is different from RandomGenerator:getSeed in that getState gets the RandomGenerator's current state, whereas getSeed gets the previously set seed number.

The value of the state string does not depend on the current operating system.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| state | string | The current state of the RandomGenerator object, represented as a string. |

#### RandomGenerator:random

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | number | The pseudo-random number. |

### Variant 2

Get uniformly distributed pseudo-random integer number within max.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| max | number |  | The maximum possible value it should return. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | number | The pseudo-random integer number. |

### Variant 3

Get uniformly distributed pseudo-random integer number within max.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| min | number |  | The minimum possible value it should return. |
| max | number |  | The maximum possible value it should return. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | number | The pseudo-random integer number. |

#### RandomGenerator:randomNormal

Get a normally distributed pseudo random number.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stddev | number | 1 | Standard deviation of the distribution. |
| mean | number | 0 | The mean of the distribution. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | number | Normally distributed random number with variance (stddev)Â² and the specified mean. |

#### RandomGenerator:setSeed

Sets the seed of the random number generator using the specified integer number.

### Variant 1

Due to Lua's use of double-precision floating point numbers, values above 2^53 cannot be accurately represented. Use the other variant of this function if your seed will have a larger value.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| seed | number |  | The integer number with which you want to seed the randomization. Must be within the range of 2^53. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

Combines two 32-bit integer numbers into a 64-bit integer value and sets the seed of the random number generator using the value.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| low | number |  | The lower 32 bits of the seed value. Must be within the range of 2^32 - 1. |
| high | number |  | The higher 32 bits of the seed value. Must be within the range of 2^32 - 1. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### RandomGenerator:setState

Sets the current state of the random number generator. The value used as an argument for this function is an opaque string and should only originate from a previous call to RandomGenerator:getState in the same major version of LÃ–VE.

This is different from RandomGenerator:setSeed in that setState directly sets the RandomGenerator's current implementation-dependent state, whereas setSeed gives it a new seed value.

The effect of the state string does not depend on the current operating system.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| state | string |  | The new state of the RandomGenerator object, represented as a string. This should originate from a previous call to RandomGenerator:getState. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*
