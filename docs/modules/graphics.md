# love.graphics

The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.

LÃ–VE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.

In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.

Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.

### Variant 1

Capture a screenshot and save it to a file at the end of the current frame.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.clear

Clears the screen or active Canvas to the specified color.

This function is called automatically before love.draw in the default love.run function. See the example in love.run for a typical use of this function.

Note that the scissor area bounds the cleared region.

In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

In versions prior to background color instead.

### Variant 1

Clears the screen to the background color in 0.9.2 and earlier, or to transparent black (0, 0, 0, 0) in LÃ–VE 0.10.0 and newer.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

Clears the screen or active Canvas to the specified color.

**Arguments:**

| g | number |  | The green channel of the color to clear the screen to. |
| b | number |  | The blue channel of the color to clear the screen to. |
| a | number | 1 | The alpha channel of the color to clear the screen to. |
| clearstencil | boolean | true | Whether to clear the active stencil buffer, if present. It can also be an integer between 0 and 255 to clear the stencil buffer to a specific value. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 3

Clears multiple active Canvases to different colors, if multiple Canvases are active at once via love.graphics.setCanvas.

A color must be specified for each active Canvas, when this function variant is used.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| color | table |  | A table in the form of {r, g, b, a} containing the color to clear the first active Canvas to. |
| ... | table |  | Additional tables for each active Canvas. |
| clearstencil | boolean | true | Whether to clear the active stencil buffer, if present. It can also be an integer between 0 and 255 to clear the stencil buffer to a specific value. |
| cleardepth | boolean | true | Whether to clear the active depth buffer, if present. It can also be a number between 0 and 1 to clear the depth buffer to a specific value. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 4

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| clearcolor | boolean |  | Whether to clear the active color canvas to transparent black (0, 0, 0, 0). Typically this should be set to false with this variant of the function. |
| clearstencil | boolean |  | Whether to clear the active stencil buffer, if present. It can also be an integer between 0 and 255 to clear the stencil buffer to a specific value. |
| cleardepth | boolean |  | Whether to clear the active depth buffer, if present. It can also be a number between 0 and 1 to clear the depth buffer to a specific value. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.discard

Discards (trashes) the contents of the screen or active Canvas. This is a performance optimization function with niche use cases.

If the active Canvas has just been changed and the 'replace' BlendMode is about to be used to draw something which covers the entire screen, calling love.graphics.discard rather than calling love.graphics.clear or doing nothing may improve performance on mobile devices.

On some desktop systems this function may do nothing.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| discardcolor | boolean | true | Whether to discard the texture(s) of the active Canvas(es) (the contents of the screen if no Canvas is active.) |
| discardstencil | boolean | true | Whether to discard the contents of the stencil buffer of the screen / active Canvas. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

**Arguments:**

| discardcolors | table |  | An array containing boolean values indicating whether to discard the texture of each active Canvas, when multiple simultaneous Canvases are active. |
| discardstencil | boolean | true | Whether to discard the contents of the stencil buffer of the screen / active Canvas. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.draw

Draws a Drawable object (an Image, Canvas, SpriteBatch, ParticleSystem, Mesh, Text object, or Video) on the screen with optional rotation, scaling and shearing.

Objects are drawn relative to their local coordinate system. The origin is by default located at the top left corner of Image and Canvas. All scaling, shearing, and rotation arguments transform the object relative to that point. Also, the position of the origin can be specified on the screen coordinate system.

It's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation. One can also use a negative scaling factor to flip about its centerline. 

Note that the offsets are applied before rotation, scaling, or shearing; scaling and shearing are applied before rotation.

The right and bottom edges of the object are shifted at an angle defined by the shearing factors.

When using the default shader anything drawn with this function will be tinted according to the currently selected color.  Set it to pure white to preserve the object's original colors.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| drawable | [Drawable](#drawable) |  | A drawable object. |
| x | number | 0 | The position to draw the object (x-axis). |

## love.graphics.drawInstanced

Draws many instances of a Mesh with a single draw call, using hardware geometry instancing.

Each instance can have unique properties (positions, colors, etc.) but will not by default unless a custom per-instance vertex attributes or the love_InstanceID GLSL 3 vertex shader variable is used, otherwise they will all render at the same position on top of each other.

## love.graphics.flushBatch

Immediately renders any pending automatically batched draws.

LÃ–VE will call this function internally as needed when most state is changed, so it is not necessary to manually call it.

The current batch will be automatically flushed by love.graphics state changes (except for the transform stack and the current color), as well as Shader:send and methods on Textures which change their state. Using a different Image in consecutive love.graphics.draw calls will also flush the current batch.

SpriteBatches, ParticleSystems, Meshes, and Text objects do their own batching and do not affect automatic batching of other draws, aside from flushing the current batch when they're drawn.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.getBackgroundColor

Gets the current background color.

In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

**Arguments:**

| b | boolean | Whether the blue color component is active when rendering. |
| a | boolean | Whether the alpha color component is active when rendering. |

## love.graphics.getDPIScale

Gets the DPI scale factor of the window.

The DPI scale factor represents relative pixel density. The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.graphics.getDPIScale() would return 2 in that case.

The love.window.fromPixels and love.window.toPixels functions can also be used to convert between units.

The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

The units of love.graphics.getWidth, love.graphics.getHeight, love.mouse.getPosition, mouse events, love.touch.getPosition, and touch events are always in DPI-scaled units rather than pixels. In LÃ–VE 0.10 and older they were in pixels.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| active | boolean | Whether the graphics module is active and able to be used. |

## love.graphics.isGammaCorrect

Gets whether gamma-correct rendering is supported and enabled. It can be enabled by setting t.gammacorrect = true in love.conf.

Not all devices support gamma-correct rendering, in which case it will be automatically disabled and this function will return false. It is supported on desktop systems which have graphics cards that are capable of using OpenGL 3 / DirectX 10, and iOS devices that can use OpenGL ES 3.

When gamma-correct rendering is enabled, many functions and objects perform automatic color conversion between sRGB and linear RGB in order for blending and shader math to be mathematically correct (which they aren't if it's not enabled.)

* The colors passed into converted from sRGB to linear RGB.

* The colors set in text with per-character colors, points with per-point colors, standard custom Meshes which use the 'VertexColor' attribute name will automatically be converted from sRGB to linear RGB when those objects are drawn.

* creating the Image.

* Everything drawn to the screen will be blended in linear RGB and then the result will be converted to sRGB for display.

* Canvases which use the 'normal' or 'srgb' CanvasFormat will have their content blended in linear RGB and the result will be stored in the canvas in sRGB, when drawing to them. When the Canvas itself is drawn, its pixel colors will be converted from sRGB to linear RGB in the same manner as Images. Keeping the canvas pixel data stored as sRGB allows for better precision (less banding) for darker colors compared to 'rgba8'.

Because most conversions are automatically handled, your own code doesn't need to worry about sRGB and linear RGB color conversions when gamma-correct rendering is enabled, except in a couple cases:

* If a Mesh with custom vertex attributes is used and one of the attributes is meant to be used as a color in a Shader, and the attribute isn't named 'VertexColor'.

* If  a Shader is used which has uniform / extern variables or other variables that are meant to be used as colors, and Shader:sendColor isn't used.

In both cases, love.math.gammaToLinear can be used to convert color values to linear RGB in Lua code, or the gammaCorrectColor (or unGammaCorrectColor if necessary) shader functions can be used inside shader code. Those shader functions ''only'' do conversions if gamma-correct rendering is actually enabled. The LOVE_GAMMA_CORRECT shader preprocessor define will be set if so.

Read more about gamma-correct rendering here, here, and here.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gammacorrect | boolean | True if gamma-correct rendering is supported and was enabled in love.conf, false otherwise. |

## love.graphics.newArrayImage

Creates a new array Image.

An array image / array texture is a single object which contains multiple 'layers' or 'slices' of 2D sub-images. It can be thought of similarly to a texture atlas or sprite sheet, but it doesn't suffer from the same tile / quad bleeding artifacts that texture atlases do â€“ although every sub-image must have the same dimensions.

A specific layer of an array image can be drawn with love.graphics.drawLayer / SpriteBatch:addLayer, or with the Quad variant of love.graphics.draw and Quad:setLayer, or via a custom Shader.

To use an array image in a Shader, it must be declared as a ArrayImage or sampler2DArray type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(ArrayImage image, vec3 texturecoord) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from a slice of the array image. The vec3 argument contains the texture coordinate in the first two components, and the 0-based slice index in the third component.

Creates an array Image given a different image file for each slice of the resulting array image object.

Illustration of how an array image works: [http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/dec/09/minecraft-like-rendering-experiments-in-opengl-4/illustrations/textures.jpg]

A DPI scale of 2 (double the normal pixel density) will result in the image taking up the same space on-screen as an image with half its pixel dimensions that has a DPI scale of 1. This allows for easily swapping out image assets that take the same space on-screen but have different pixel densities, which makes supporting high-dpi / retina resolution require less code logic.

In order to use an Array Texture or other non-2D texture types as the main texture in a custom void effect() variant must be used in the pixel shader, and MainTex must be declared as an ArrayImage or sampler2DArray like so: uniform ArrayImage MainTex;.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| slices | table |  | A table containing filepaths to images (or File, FileData, ImageData, or CompressedImageData objects), in an array. Each sub-image must have the same dimensions. A table of tables can also be given, where each sub-table contains all mipmap levels for the slice index of that sub-table. |
| settings | table | nil | Optional table of settings to configure the array image, containing the following fields: (see table fields below) |

**settings table fields:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mipmaps | boolean | false | True to make the image use mipmaps, false to disable them. Mipmaps will be automatically generated if the image isn't a compressed texture format. |
| linear | boolean | false | True to treat the image's pixels as linear instead of sRGB, when gamma correct rendering is enabled. Most images are authored as sRGB. |
| dpiscale | number | 1 | The DPI scale to use when drawing the array image and calling getWidth/getHeight. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| image | [Image](#image) | An Array Image object. |

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vertices | table |  | The table filled with vertex information tables for each vertex as follows: (see table fields below) |

### Variant 3

Creates a Mesh with custom vertex attributes and the specified vertex data.

The values in each vertex table are in the same order as the vertex attributes in the specified vertex format. If no value is supplied for a specific vertex attribute component, it will be set to a default value of 0 if its data type is 'float', or 1 if its data type is 'byte'.

If the data type of an attribute is 'float', components can be in the range 1 to 4, if the data type is 'byte' it must be 4.

If a custom vertex attribute uses the name 'VertexPosition', 'VertexTexCoord', or 'VertexColor', then the vertex data for that vertex attribute will be used for the standard vertex positions, texture coordinates, or vertex colors respectively, when drawing the Mesh. Otherwise a Vertex Shader is required in order to make use of the vertex attribute when the Mesh is drawn.

A Mesh '''must''' have a 'VertexPosition' attribute in order to be drawn, but it can be attached from a different Mesh via Mesh:attachAttribute.

To use a custom named vertex attribute in a Vertex Shader, it must be declared as an attribute variable of the same name. Variables can be sent from Vertex Shader code to Pixel Shader code by making a varying variable. For example:

''Vertex Shader code''

attribute vec2 CoolVertexAttribute;

varying vec2 CoolVariable;

vec4 position(mat4 transform_projection, vec4 vertex_position)

{

    CoolVariable = CoolVertexAttribute;

    return transform_projection * vertex_position;

}

''Pixel Shader code''

varying vec2 CoolVariable;

vec4 effect(vec4 color, Image tex, vec2 texcoord, vec2 pixcoord)

{

    vec4 texcolor = Texel(tex, texcoord + CoolVariable);

    return texcolor * color;

}

## love.graphics.newVolumeImage

Creates a new volume (3D) Image.

Volume images are 3D textures with width, height, and depth. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).

To use a volume image in a Shader, it must be declared as a VolumeImage or sampler3D type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(VolumeImage image, vec3 texcoords) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the volume image. The vec3 argument is a normalized texture coordinate with the z component representing the depth to sample at (ranging from 1).

Volume images are typically used as lookup tables in shaders for color grading, for example, because sampling using a texture coordinate that is partway in between two pixels can interpolate across all 3 dimensions in the volume image, resulting in a smooth gradient even when a small-sized volume image is used as the lookup table.

Array images are a much better choice than volume images for storing multiple different sprites in a single array image for directly drawing them.

Creates a volume Image given multiple image files with matching dimensions.

Volume images are not supported on some older mobile devices. Use love.graphics.getTextureTypes to check at runtime.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| layers | table |  | A table containing filepaths to images (or File, FileData, ImageData, or CompressedImageData objects), in an array. A table of tables can also be given, where each sub-table represents a single mipmap level and contains all layers for that mipmap. |
| settings | table | nil | Optional table of settings to configure the volume image, containing the following fields: (see table fields below) |

**settings table fields:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mipmaps | boolean | false | True to make the image use mipmaps, false to disable them. Mipmaps will be automatically generated if the image isn't a compressed texture format. |
| linear | boolean | false | True to treat the image's pixels as linear instead of sRGB, when gamma correct rendering is enabled. Most images are authored as sRGB. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| image | [Image](#image) | A volume Image object. |

## love.graphics.present

Displays the results of drawing operations on the screen.

This function is used when writing your own love.run function. It presents all the results of your drawing operations on the screen. See the example in love.run for a typical use of this function.

* If love.window.setMode has vsync equal to true, this function can't run more frequently than the refresh rate (e.g. 60 Hz), and will halt the program until ready if necessary.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.print

Draws text on screen. If no Font is set, one will be created and set (once) if needed.

As of LOVE 0.7.1, when using translation and scaling functions while drawing text, this function assumes the scale occurs first.  If you don't script with this in mind, the text won't be in the right position, or possibly even on screen.

love.graphics.print and love.graphics.printf both support UTF-8 encoding. You'll also need a proper Font for special characters.

In versions prior to 11.0, color and byte component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

## love.graphics.printf

Draws formatted text, with word wrap and alignment.

See additional notes in love.graphics.print.

The word wrap limit is applied before any scaling, rotation, and other coordinate transformations. Therefore the amount of text per line stays constant given the same wrap limit, even if the scale arguments change.

In version 0.9.2 and earlier, wrapping was implemented by breaking up words by spaces and putting them back together to make sure things fit nicely within the limit provided. However, due to the way this is done, extra spaces between words would end up missing when printed on the screen, and some lines could overflow past the provided wrap limit. In version 0.10.0 and newer this is no longer the case.

In versions prior to 11.0, color and byte component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

## love.graphics.replaceTransform

Replaces the current coordinate transformation with the given Transform object.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transform | Transform |  | The Transform object to replace the current graphics coordinate transform with. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.reset

Resets the current graphics settings.

Calling reset makes the current drawing color white, the current background color black, disables any active color component masks, disables wireframe mode and resets the current graphics transformation to the origin. It also sets both the point and line drawing modes to smooth and their sizes to 1.0.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.rotate

Rotates the coordinate system in two dimensions.

Calling this function affects all future drawing operations by rotating the coordinate system around the origin by the given amount of radians. This change lasts until love.draw() exits.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| angle | number |  | The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.graphics.scale

Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.

By default the coordinate system in LÃ–VE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.

After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.

Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.

Scaling lasts until love.draw() exits.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sx | number |  | The scaling in the direction of the x-axis. |
| sy | number | sx | The scaling in the direction of the y-axis. If omitted, it defaults to same as parameter sx. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

| alpha | number | 1 | The alpha component (0-1). |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rgba | table |  | A numerical indexed table with the red, green, blue and alpha values as numbers. The alpha is optional and defaults to 1 if it is left out. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mode | [BlendMode](#blendmode) |  | The blend mode to use. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

The default 'alphamultiply' alpha mode should normally be preferred except when drawing content with pre-multiplied alpha. If content is drawn to a Canvas using the 'alphamultiply' mode, the Canvas texture will have pre-multiplied alpha afterwards, so the 'premultiplied' alpha mode should generally be used when drawing a Canvas to the screen.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mode | [BlendMode](#blendmode) |  | The blend mode to use. |
| alphamode | [BlendAlphaMode](#blendalphamode) | 'alphamultiply' | What to do with the alpha of drawn objects when blending. |

## love.graphics.setCanvas

Captures drawing operations to a Canvas.

### Variant 1

Sets the render target to a specified stencil or depth testing with an active Canvas, the stencil buffer or depth buffer must be explicitly enabled in setCanvas via the variants below.

Note that no canvas should be active when ''love.graphics.present'' is called. ''love.graphics.present'' is called at the end of love.draw in the default love.run, hence if you activate a canvas using this function, you normally need to deactivate it at some point before ''love.draw'' finishes.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| canvas | [Canvas](#canvas) |  | The new target. |
| mipmap | number | 1 | The mipmap level to render to, for Canvases with mipmaps. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

Resets the render target to the screen, i.e. re-enables drawing to the screen.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 3

Sets the render target to multiple simultaneous 2D Canvases. All drawing operations until the next ''love.graphics.setCanvas'' call will be redirected to the specified canvases and not shown on the screen.

Normally all drawing operations will draw only to the first canvas passed to the function, but that can be changed if a pixel shader is used with the void effect function instead of the regular vec4 effect.

All canvas arguments must have the same widths and heights and the same texture type. Not all computers which support Canvases will support multiple render targets. If love.graphics.isSupported('multicanvas') returns true, at least 4 simultaneously active canvases are supported.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| canvas1 | [Canvas](#canvas) |  | The first render target. |
| canvas2 | [Canvas](#canvas) |  | The second render target. |
| ... | [Canvas](#canvas) |  | More canvases. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| canvas | [Canvas](#canvas) |  | The new render target. |
| slice | number |  | For cubemaps this is the cube face index to render to (between 1 and 6). For Array textures this is the array layer. For volume textures this is the depth slice. 2D canvases should use a value of 1. |
| mipmap | number | 1 | The mipmap level to render to, for Canvases with mipmaps. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 5

Sets the active render target(s) and active stencil and depth buffers based on the specified setup information. All drawing operations until the next ''love.graphics.setCanvas'' call will be redirected to the specified Canvases and not shown on the screen.

The RenderTargetSetup parameters can either be a Canvas|[1]|The Canvas to use for this active render target.}}

{{param|number|mipmap (1)|The mipmap level to render to, for Canvases with [[Texture:getMipmapCount|mipmaps.}}

{{param|number|layer (1)|Only used for Volume and Array-type Canvases. For Array textures this is the array layer to render to. For volume textures this is the depth slice.}}

{{param|number|face (1)|Only used for Cubemap-type Canvases. The cube face index to render to (between 1 and 6)}}

## love.graphics.stencil

Draws geometry as a stencil.

The geometry drawn by the supplied function sets invisible stencil values of pixels, instead of setting pixel colors. The stencil buffer (which contains those stencil values) can act like a mask / stencil - love.graphics.setStencilTest can be used afterward to determine how further rendering is affected by the stencil values in each pixel.

Stencil values are integers within the range of 255.

It is possible to draw to the screen and to the stencil values of pixels at the same time, by using love.graphics.setColorMask inside the stencil function to enable drawing to all color components.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| screenY | number | The y component of the position with graphics transformations applied. |

## love.graphics.translate

Translates the coordinate system in two dimensions.

When this function is called with two numbers, dx, and dy, all the following drawing operations take effect as if their x and y coordinates were x+dx and y+dy. 

Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.

This change lasts until love.draw() exits or else a love.graphics.pop reverts to a previous love.graphics.push.

Translating using whole numbers will prevent tearing/blurring of images and fonts draw after translating.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dx | number |  | The translation relative to the x-axis. |
| dy | number |  | The translation relative to the y-axis. |

| status | boolean | true if specified shader code doesn't contain any errors. false otherwise. |
| message | string | Reason why shader code validation failed (or nil if validation succeded). |

## Types

## Canvas

A Canvas is used for off-screen rendering. Think of it as an invisible screen that you can draw to, but that will not be visible until you draw it to the actual visible screen. It is also known as "render to texture".

By drawing things that do not change position often (such as background items) to the Canvas, and then drawing the entire Canvas instead of each item,  you can reduce the number of draw operations performed each frame.

In versions prior to love.graphics.isSupported("canvas") could be used to check for support at runtime.

#### SpriteBatch:attachAttribute

Attaches a per-vertex attribute from a Mesh onto this SpriteBatch, for use when drawing. This can be combined with a Shader to augment a SpriteBatch with per-vertex or additional per-sprite information instead of just having per-sprite colors.

Each sprite in a SpriteBatch has 4 vertices in the following order: top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right. The index returned by SpriteBatch:add (and used by SpriteBatch:set) can used to determine the first vertex of a specific sprite with the formula 1 + 4 * ( id - 1 ).

If a created with a custom vertex format, it will have 3 vertex attributes named VertexPosition, VertexTexCoord, and VertexColor. If vertex attributes with those names are attached to the SpriteBatch, it will override the SpriteBatch's sprite positions, texture coordinates, and sprite colors, respectively.

Custom named attributes can be accessed in a vertex shader by declaring them as attribute vec4 MyCustomAttributeName; at the top-level of the vertex shader code. The name must match what was specified in the Mesh's vertex format and in the name argument of SpriteBatch:attachAttribute.

A Mesh must have at least 4 * SpriteBatch:getBufferSize vertices in order to be attachable to a SpriteBatch.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string |  | The name of the vertex attribute to attach. |
| mesh | [Mesh](#mesh) |  | The Mesh to get the vertex attribute from. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### SpriteBatch:clear

Removes all sprites from the buffer.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### SpriteBatch:flush

Immediately sends all new and modified sprite data in the batch to the graphics card.

Normally it isn't necessary to call this method as love.graphics.draw(spritebatch, ...) will do it automatically if needed, but explicitly using SpriteBatch:flush gives more control over when the work happens.

If this method is used, it generally shouldn't be called more than once (at most) between love.graphics.draw(spritebatch, ...) calls.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### SpriteBatch:getBufferSize

Gets the maximum number of sprites the SpriteBatch can hold.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| size | number | The maximum number of sprites the batch can hold. |

#### SpriteBatch:getColor

Gets the color that will be used for the next add and set operations.

If no color has been set with SpriteBatch:setColor or the current SpriteBatch color has been cleared, this method will return nil.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | number | The red component (0-1). |

### Variant 2

Changes a sprite with a Quad in the batch. This requires the index returned by SpriteBatch:add or SpriteBatch:addLayer.

SpriteBatches do not support removing individual sprites. One can do a pseudo removal (instead of clearing and re-adding everything) by:

SpriteBatch:set(id, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

This makes all the sprite's vertices equal (because the x and y scales are 0), which prevents the GPU from fully processing the sprite when drawing the SpriteBatch.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| spriteindex | number |  | The index of the sprite that will be changed. |
| quad | [Quad](#quad) |  | The Quad used on the image of the batch. |

| ky | number | 0 | Shear factor (y-axis). |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### SpriteBatch:setColor

Sets the color that will be used for the next add and set operations. Calling the function without arguments will disable all per-sprite colors for the SpriteBatch.

In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

In version 0.9.2 and older, the global color set with love.graphics.setColor will not work on the SpriteBatch if any of the sprites has its own color.

**Supertypes:** Drawable, Object

### Methods

#### Texture:getDPIScale

Gets the DPI scale factor of the Texture.

The DPI scale factor represents relative pixel density. A DPI scale factor of 2 means the texture has twice the pixel density in each dimension (4 times as many pixels in the same area) compared to a texture with a DPI scale factor of 1.

For example, a texture with pixel dimensions of 100x100 with a DPI scale factor of 2 will be drawn as if it was 50x50. This is useful with high-dpi /  retina displays to easily allow swapping out higher or lower pixel density Images and Canvases without needing any extra manual scaling logic.

Non-readable Canvases can still be rendered to.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### Texture:setDepthSampleMode

Sets the comparison mode used when sampling from a depth texture in a shader. Depth texture comparison modes are advanced low-level functionality typically used with shadow mapping in 3D.

When using a depth texture with a comparison mode set in a shader, it must be declared as a sampler2DShadow and used in a GLSL 3 Shader. The result of accessing the texture in the shader will return a float between 0 and 1, proportional to the number of samples (up to 4 samples will be used if bilinear filtering is enabled) that passed the test set by the comparison operation.

Depth texture comparison can only be used with readable depth-formatted Canvases.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| compare | [CompareMode](#comparemode) |  | The comparison mode used when sampling from this texture in a shader. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

| mag | [FilterMode](#filtermode) | min | Filter mode to use when magnifying the texture (rendering it at a larger size on-screen than its size in pixels). |
| anisotropy | number | 1 | Maximum amount of anisotropic filtering to use. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### Texture:setMipmapFilter

Sets the mipmap filter mode for a Texture. Prior to 11.0 this method only worked on Images.

Mipmapping is useful when drawing a texture at a reduced scale. It can improve performance and reduce aliasing issues.

In created with the mipmaps flag enabled for the mipmap filter to have any effect. In versions prior to 0.10.0 it's best to call this method directly after creating the image with love.graphics.newImage, to avoid bugs in certain graphics drivers.

Due to hardware restrictions and driver bugs, in versions prior to 0.10.0 images that weren't loaded from a CompressedData must have power-of-two dimensions (64x64, 512x256, etc.) to use mipmaps.

### Variant 1

On mobile devices (Android and iOS), the sharpness parameter is not supported and will do nothing. You can use a custom compressed and its CompressedData has mipmap data included, it will use that.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filtermode | [FilterMode](#filtermode) |  | The filter mode to use in between mipmap levels. 'nearest' will often give better performance. |
| sharpness | number | 0 | A positive sharpness value makes the texture use a more detailed mipmap level when drawing, at the expense of performance. A negative value does the reverse. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

### Variant 2

Disables mipmap filtering.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

*No return values*

#### Texture:setWrap

Sets the wrapping properties of a Texture.

This function sets the way a Texture is repeated when it is drawn with a Quad that is larger than the texture's extent, or when a custom Shader is used which uses texture coordinates outside of [0, 1]. A texture may be clamped or set to repeat in both horizontal and vertical directions.

Clamped textures appear only once (with the edges of the texture stretching to fill the extent of the Quad), whereas repeated ones repeat as many times as there is room in the Quad.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| horiz | [WrapMode](#wrapmode) |  | Horizontal wrapping mode of the texture. |
| vert | [WrapMode](#wrapmode) | horiz | Vertical wrapping mode of the texture. |
