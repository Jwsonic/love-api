## Functions

## love.joystick.getGamepadMappingString

Gets the full gamepad mapping string of the Joysticks which have the given GUID, or nil if the GUID isn't recognized as a gamepad.

The mapping string contains binding information used to map the Joystick's buttons an axes to the standard gamepad layout, and can be used later with love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings.

**Arguments:**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| guid | string |  | The GUID value to get the mapping string for. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mappingstring | string | A string containing the Joystick's gamepad mappings, or nil if the GUID is not recognized as a gamepad. |

## love.joystick.getJoystickCount

Gets the number of connected joysticks.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| joystickcount | number | The number of connected joysticks. |

## love.joystick.getJoysticks

| joysticks | table | The list of currently connected Joysticks. |

## love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings

Loads a gamepad mappings string or file created with love.joystick.saveGamepadMappings.

It also recognizes any SDL gamecontroller mapping string, such as those created with Steam's Big Picture controller configure interface, or this nice database. If a new mapping is loaded for an already known controller GUID, the later version will overwrite the one currently loaded.

| mappings | string |  | The mappings string to load. |

**Returns:**

*No return values*

## love.joystick.saveGamepadMappings

Saves the virtual gamepad mappings of all recognized as gamepads and have either been recently used or their gamepad bindings have been modified.

The mappings are stored as a string for use with love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings.

### Variant 1

Saves the gamepad mappings of all relevant joysticks to a file.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filename | string |  | The filename to save the mappings string to. |

**Returns:**

## love.joystick.setGamepadMapping

Binds a virtual gamepad input to a button, axis or hat for all Joysticks of a certain type. For example, if this function is used with a GUID returned by a Dualshock 3 controller in OS X, the binding will affect Joystick:getGamepadAxis and Joystick:isGamepadDown for ''all'' Dualshock 3 controllers used with the game when run in OS X.

LÃ–VE includes built-in gamepad bindings for many common controllers. This function lets you change the bindings or add new ones for types of Joysticks which aren't recognized as gamepads by default.

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | boolean | Whether the virtual gamepad button was successfully bound. |

### Variant 2

| anyDown | boolean | True if any supplied button is down, false if not. |

#### Joystick:isVibrationSupported

Gets whether the Joystick supports vibration.

The very first call to this function may take more time than expected because SDL's Haptic / Force Feedback subsystem needs to be initialized.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| supported | boolean | True if rumble / force feedback vibration is supported on this Joystick, false if not. |

#### Joystick:setVibration

Sets the vibration motor speeds on a Joystick with rumble support. Most common gamepads have this functionality, although not all drivers give proper support. Use Joystick:isVibrationSupported to check.

### Variant 1

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| left | number |  | Strength of the left vibration motor on the Joystick. Must be in the range of 1. |

### Variant 3

If the Joystick only has a single vibration motor, it will still work but it will use the largest value of the left and right parameters.

The Xbox 360 controller on Mac OS X only has support for vibration if a modified version of the Tattiebogle driver is used.

The very first call to this function may take more time than expected because SDL's Haptic / Force Feedback subsystem needs to be initialized.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| left | number |  | Strength of the left vibration motor on the Joystick. Must be in the range of 1. |
| right | number |  | Strength of the right vibration motor on the Joystick. Must be in the range of 1. |
| duration | number | -1 | The duration of the vibration in seconds. A negative value means infinite duration. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | boolean | True if the vibration was successfully applied, false if not. |
