## Functions

## love.touch.getPosition

Gets the current position of the specified touch-press, in pixels.

The unofficial Android and iOS ports of LÃ–VE 0.9.2 reported touch-press positions as normalized values in the range of 1, whereas this API reports positions in pixels.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | light userdata |  | The identifier of the touch-press. Use love.touch.getTouches, love.touchpressed, or love.touchmoved to obtain touch id values. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | The position along the x-axis of the touch-press inside the window, in pixels. |
| y | number | The position along the y-axis of the touch-press inside the window, in pixels. |

## love.touch.getPressure

Gets the current pressure of the specified touch-press.

**Arguments:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | light userdata |  | The identifier of the touch-press. Use love.touch.getTouches, love.touchpressed, or love.touchmoved to obtain touch id values. |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pressure | number | The pressure of the touch-press. Most touch screens aren't pressure sensitive, in which case the pressure will be 1. |

## love.touch.getTouches

Gets a list of all active touch-presses.

The id values are the same as those used as arguments to love.touchpressed, love.touchmoved, and love.touchreleased.

The id value of a specific touch-press is only guaranteed to be unique for the duration of that touch-press. As soon as love.touchreleased is called using that id, it may be reused for a new touch-press via love.touchpressed.

**Arguments:**

*No arguments*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| touches | table | A list of active touch-press id values, which can be used with love.touch.getPosition. |
